# To start
You must first locate the access Key that is called .exe then open it. You will be introducted to a panel that gives you a few numbers.

# first start
made a array and then removed the number 3 from it. (there were two number 3s this was a test to see if it will delete both of them).

# second change
I copied all of the values of the first list to the second list and then printed it to the panel.

# thirst change
I made another copy but in a different way from the scond list.

# fourth change
Removed the 42 and 3.

# fifth change
Destroyed the first list and tied to print it. This should be blank.

# sixth change
Printed the second list

# seventh change
